= GrokPhoto Default Theme

== File Structure

=== Layout
The layout for your public site is in: layout/layout.html.haml

It's an annoying rails thing that it needs to be in it's own directory, but I'll have a workaround soon.

=== Partials
There are three partials, all beginning with an underscore.
* _header.html.haml
* _sidebar.html.haml
* _footer.html.haml

The header and the footer are used in the layout. The sidebar is used in your basic pages and portfolio.

=== Home / Landing Page
home.html.haml

=== Portfolios
The portfolio.html.haml page is used to showcase your portfolio photos. It contains a javascript image slideshow with thumbnails as well as links to each of the other galleries.

=== Pages
The page.html.haml page holds all of your textual content like the usual "About Me" and "Rates" information.

=== Sitemap
sitemap.html.haml is a basic sitemap that no one will ever bother visiting. Potentially good for SEO though.
A google sitemap is already being generated for all themes.
